# Bootstrap

End-to-end provisioning of the `shrike` Windows host from a fresh install.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 installed with a local admin account
- D:\ data drive present (used for homelab state, e.g. `D:\demucs`)
- Ansible 2.16+ on the controller with collections:
  - `ansible.windows`
  - `community.windows`
  - `chocolatey.chocolatey`

### Controller setup with Nix

`shell.nix` at the repo root provisions `ansible-core`, `pywinrm`, and the
collections listed in `ansible/requirements.yml` on shell entry. Collections
land in repo-local `.ansible/collections` (gitignored).

```sh
nix-shell
```

### Controller setup without Nix

```sh
pip install ansible-core pywinrm
ansible-galaxy collection install -r ansible/requirements.yml
```

## One-time setup on shrike

Run from an elevated PowerShell session on `shrike`.

### Create a dedicated local admin for Ansible

Do **not** authenticate as a Microsoft-account-linked user. MSA accounts on
Windows 10/11 default to "passwordless" mode (the "improved security" toggle
under Sign-in options), which rejects NTLM password auth even with the
correct password. MFA on the MSA breaks it further. A plain local admin
sidesteps all of it.

```powershell
$pw = Read-Host -AsSecureString "ansible password"
New-LocalUser -Name ansible -Password $pw -PasswordNeverExpires:$true -AccountNeverExpires
Add-LocalGroupMember -Group Administrators -Member ansible
```

Inventory ships with `ansible_user=ansible`. If you choose a different name,
update `ansible/inventory.ini` to match.

### Enable WinRM

```powershell
winrm quickconfig -q
Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Service\Auth\Basic $false
Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Service\AllowUnencrypted $true
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "WinRM HTTP" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 5985 -Action Allow -Profile Domain,Private
```

NTLM over HTTP on 5985 is the default in `inventory.ini`. For HTTPS, configure
a self-signed cert on 5986 and update the inventory accordingly.

## Configure inventory

Edit `ansible/inventory.ini`:

- `ansible_host` — resolvable hostname or IP
- `ansible_user` — the local admin you created above (default: `ansible`)

The password is not stored in inventory. Ansible prompts for it on stdin via
`--ask-pass`. This is the officially supported workflow — no vault or
external credential lookup.

## Run

Two transports, run in order. The first two commands are WinRM-as-`ansible`;
the last is SSH-as-`mail` and requires the SSH transport to have been
set up first (`shrike-ssh-bootstrap.yml` does that, idempotently — safe
to re-run, no-op after the first success).

```sh
cd ansible
ansible -m win_ping windows --ask-pass                           # connectivity smoke test
ansible-playbook playbooks/shrike-bootstrap.yml --ask-pass       # config baseline
ansible-playbook playbooks/shrike-ssh-bootstrap.yml --ask-pass   # one-time: OpenSSH + key
ansible-playbook playbooks/shrike-desktop-apps.yml               # winget desktop apps
```

The SSH bootstrap publishes your controller's `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
into shrike's `administrators_authorized_keys`. Generate a keypair
first if you don't have one (`ssh-keygen -t ed25519`). See
`docs/unattended.md` for the full transport rationale and verification
steps.

## What the bootstrap playbook does

1. **common** — host baseline: default Microsoft bloatware AppX
   removal, telemetry off, registry tweaks (Bing/Cortana off, classic
   Win11 right-click context menu), D:\ folder relocation, and the
   networking block (WoL prep, ICMPv4 echo, NTP, Sleep-on-LAN NSSM
   service).
2. **gaming** — Steam Remote Play registry + firewall (UDP 27031-27036).
3. **services** — clones `homelab-rtx`, `homelab-demucs`, `homelab-ollama`
   under `C:\homelab\`, seeds `.env` from `.env.example` on first clone, runs
   each repo's `scripts/up.ps1` to install the NSSM services.

## What the desktop-apps playbook does

Runs the `desktop_apps` role over the SSH-as-`mail` transport. The role
loops over the canonical winget package list
(`ansible/roles/desktop_apps/defaults/main.yml`) and installs / upgrades
each via `winget install --exact`. Idempotent — already-installed
packages are detected and skipped.

NVIDIA driver updates are deliberately not run by the playbook even
though TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker is installed by it; see
`docs/maintenance.md`.

## After first run

For each service under `C:\homelab\<repo>\.env`, replace placeholder values
(notably `*_PYTHON_EXE` and any service-specific paths) and re-run the
playbook — `up.ps1` is idempotent.

## Troubleshooting

### Time-windowed dashboards show no data (charts, history)

Symptom: a service is healthy, its API returns rows, but a UI that filters
to "last N minutes" (e.g. the rtx landing page chart) shows nothing.

Cause: `w32time` on shrike is not syncing. The wall clock drifts from real
time, so stored timestamps fall outside the browser's filter window.

Check:

```powershell
w32tm /query /status
```

`Stratum: 0` and `Leap Indicator: 3 (not synchronized)` mean NTP isn't
running. The `common` role's networking block configures NTP (Cloudflare
+ uk.pool.ntp.org) and forces a resync. Re-run the playbook (or use
`--start-at-task "Configure NTP peers and force resync"`).

After: stratum should be 2-3 and Source should name a peer. New samples
written by services from that point on are correctly timestamped; older
rows in CSVs / state stores remain skewed (use "All" range to see them, or
let new data accumulate).

## Re-running

The playbook is idempotent. Re-run any time to converge state — no slicing
needed. If you want to re-run from a particular task without doing the
earlier ones, use `--start-at-task "<task name>"`:

```sh
ansible-playbook playbooks/shrike-bootstrap.yml --list-tasks
ansible-playbook playbooks/shrike-bootstrap.yml --start-at-task "Configure NTP peers and force resync" --ask-pass
```

Task-level tags have been removed deliberately — see the roadmap in the
top-level `README.md` for candidate slices to reintroduce when needed.
